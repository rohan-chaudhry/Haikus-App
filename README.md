This app allows users to upload an image, write three lines below, and export the entire view as an image. 

There is a syllable counter next to each line. It isn't perfect, but serves as a reference to meet the 5/7/5 haiku format. Not meeting the guideline exactly will not block the user from exporting the image. 

Quick and fun weekend project :)
